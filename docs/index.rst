The COMPAS model encompasses data structures and algorithms for: a) modeling individual elements of Discrete Element Assemblies, b) tracking interactions between them, commonly used for cases such as joinery or abstractly tracking adjacency in the form of a graph, and c) storing the elements in a hierarchical manner, namely a tree data structure. The package itself serves as a fundamental data structure for various modeling or structural applications and is primarily utilized as a container to store and visualize data. The data structure is compatible with COMPAS 2.0 and above.

COMPAS Model is a next generation of `compas_assembly <https://blockresearchgroup.github.io/compas_assembly/0.6.2/>`_ which is based on compas <= 1.17.9.
